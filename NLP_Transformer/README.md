# Attention is all you need: A Pytorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model in "[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin, arxiv, 2017). 


A novel sequence to sequence framework utilizes the **self-attention mechanism**, instead of Convolution operation or Recurrent structure, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on **WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task**. (2017/06/12)

> The official Tensorflow Implementation can be found in: [tensorflow/tensor2tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py).

> To learn more about self-attention mechanism, you could read "[A Structured Self-attentive Sentence Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130)".

The project support training and translation with trained model now.

Note that this project is still a work in progress.

**BPE related parts are not yet fully tested.**


If there is any suggestion or error, feel free to fire an issue to let me know. :)


# Usage

## WMT'16 Multimodal Translation: de-en

An example of training for the WMT'16 Multimodal Translation task (http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/multimodal-task.html).

### 0) Download the spacy language model.
```bash
# conda install -c conda-forge spacy 
python -m spacy download en
python -m spacy download de
```

### 1) Preprocess the data with torchtext and spacy.
```bash
python preprocess.py -lang_src de -lang_trg en -share_vocab -save_data m30k_deen_shr.pkl
```

### 2) Train the model
```bash
execute run.sh
```

### 3) Test the model
```bash
python translate.py -data_pkl m30k_deen_shr.pkl -model trained.chkpt -output prediction.txt
```
